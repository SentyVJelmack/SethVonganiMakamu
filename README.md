## 🚀 About Me

I'm a learner in the **ALX Frontend Web Development** program, and I’ve revamped this GitHub profile to help me stand out in my job search.

I started with software engineering because I’ve always been fascinated by how websites work — how design and interactivity shape what people experience online. I'm passionate about creating clean, responsive, and meaningful applications that combine beautiful design with functionality.

My aim is to become a **world-class frontend developer**, crafting seamless user experiences that solve real problems. That's why I'm eager to work on:

- 🌐 Interactive web applications  
- 🎨 Responsive UI/UX projects  
- 🔧 Open-source frontend tools
